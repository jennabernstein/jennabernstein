### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on learning more about the software development process and strengthening my skills in Java. I enjoy learning these practical skills in the classroom which can be applied to software engineering roles in the future.

I love spending my free time doing puzzles, listening to music, working out, playing field hockey, enjoying nature, and traveling.
